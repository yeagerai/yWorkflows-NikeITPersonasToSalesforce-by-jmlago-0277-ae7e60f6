# Component Name

ExtractNameAndEmail

## Description

The ExtractNameAndEmail component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow. It is designed to extract the name and email from a list of personas and return a list of dictionaries containing the name and email of each valid persona.

## Input and Output Models

### Input Model

The input model for this component is `ExtractNameAndEmailInputDict`. It consists of a single attribute:

- `persona_list`: A list of dictionaries containing any number of key-value pairs, with each dictionary representing a persona.

### Output Model

The output model for this component is `ExtractNameAndEmailOutputDict`. It consists of a single attribute:

- `name_email_list`: A list of dictionaries containing the extracted `'name'` and `'email'` of each valid persona from the input list.

## Parameters

This component has no parameters. The input data is passed directly to the `transform()` method as an argument of the `ExtractNameAndEmailInputDict` type.

## Transform Function

The `transform()` method processes the input data in the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the extracted name and email dictionaries.
2. Loop through each persona in `args.persona_list`.
3. Check if both 'name' and 'email' keys are present in the persona.
4. If both keys are present, append a dictionary containing the `'name'` and `'email'` of the persona to the `result` list.
5. Create an output object of type `ExtractNameAndEmailOutputDict`, containing the `name_email_list` attribute as the `result` list.
6. Return the output object.

## External Dependencies

This component depends on the following external libraries:

- `typing`: Provides type hints for better code readability and static typing.
- `fastapi`: Used to create an HTTP API for the component.
- `pydantic`: Provides data validation and parsing for input and output data models by using Python type annotations.

## API Calls

There are no external API calls made by the component.

## Error Handling

This component does not explicitly handle errors. If input data does not meet the requirements of the `ExtractNameAndEmailInputDict` model, a validation error will be raised by Pydantic.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

To use the ExtractNameAndEmail component within a Yeager Workflow, create an instance of the component and call its `transform()` method, providing an input object of type `ExtractNameAndEmailInputDict`:
